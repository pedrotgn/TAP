#### Proposed exercises

1. Bank Problem

This is the problem of modeling a bank. The bank has a list of accounts and
a list of customers. Customers have their ID, name, address and
phone number. Each account can belong to only one customer.

In each account we can deposit money, withdraw money, check balances, change the client,
and perform a monthly revision. All accounts have a commission of 10 euros.
The monthly revision does the following:

balance = balance + balance * interest_rate - accout_comission

On a bank we can carry out a monthly revision of all accounts of it.

There are four types of accounts: CheckingAccount (CA), SaveAccount (SA), InvestFund (IF) and BonusAccount (BA).
The CheckingAccount has an interest of 0.1, SaveAccount has 0.2, IF has 0.34, and BA 0.6.

We cannot retrieve money from IF.
We cannot retrieve money from any account if there is nof money.
The monthly review of the CA account does not pay commission.

Implement a lottery for the bank class: it will give a random prize to one of the accounts (300 euros) form.

Generate the Javadoc of this problem. Finally, allow the storage and recovery of the bank of a serialized file.


The problem must be implemented in Java, and create a test to check the functionality of the classes.
In particular, show the balances before and after a monthly revision.
No creation of graphical or textual interface is required.
